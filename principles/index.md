The [LeSS rules](../rules/index.html) define the LeSS Framework. But the rules are minimalistic and do not give answers as to how best to apply LeSS in your specific context. The LeSS principles provide the basis for making those decisions.

## Other Principles?

The ten LeSS Principles guided us in creating LeSS and they should guide you when you are implementing LeSS. Other useful principles you might want to explore:

* [Agile Manifesto](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/)
* Avoiding False Dichotomies (explored in [Scaling Agile and Lean Development](http://www.amazon.com/Scaling-Lean-Agile-Development-Organizational/dp/0321480961))
* Be Agile Rather than Do Agile (explored in [Scaling Agile and Lean Development](http://www.amazon.com/Scaling-Lean-Agile-Development-Organizational/dp/0321480961))
* Total Quality Management/Control (an early and excellent book on this is [What is Total Quality Control: The Japanese Way](http://www.amazon.com/What-Total-Quality-Control-Japanese/dp/0139524339))
* Deming's 14 points (from [Out of the Crisis](http://www.amazon.com/Out-Crisis-W-Edwards-Deming/dp/0262541157))
