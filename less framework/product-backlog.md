Multiple teams building a single product work from a **single** Product Backlog that defines all of the work to be done on the product. They do not each have their own Product Backlog. Product Backlog Items are not pre-assigned to the teams. The LeSS Product Backlog is the same as in a one-team Scrum environment.

## Properties of a good Product Backlog

A good Product Backlog must:

* have estimates for all items,
* have finer grained items at the top and coarser grained items further down, and
* be prioritized.

## Product Backlog tools

Use simple tools for the Product Backlog. We've seen LeSS Huge initiatives (with thousands of people) manage the Product Backlog with a simple spreadsheet. Avoid unnecessary and costly complication by using the simplest tools possible for managing the Product Backlog.

Here is a side note regarding tool usage in Scrum and in LeSS. It is common for organizations to look for tools to solve their problems even though tools are rarely the cause of the problem. Avoid solving problems with tools unless you truly, deeply understand the problem and consider a tool to be the right solution for that particular problem.
